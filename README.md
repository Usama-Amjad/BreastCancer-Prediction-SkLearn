# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Using_ScikitLearn
In this  project, we  build a Logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either Malignant or Benign. We  use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle. Our goal is to use a simple logistic regression classifier for cancer classification. We carryed out the entire project on the Google Colab environment.

By doing this project, i was able to build the logistic regression classifier to classify between cancerous and noncancerous patients. Additionally, will also be able to clean and prepare data for analysis.
